Welcome to this repository! It contains different useful scripts and examples on statistics, mainly consisting of the "Bayesian" inferential kind. It contains an example on how to use the ABC-rejection methods on Ordinairy Least Squared (OLS) regression, a Frankenstein-monster grid approximation and multiple scripts for JAGS. Scripts are freely available for manipulation and pirating.<br />
