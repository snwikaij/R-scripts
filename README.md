<h1 align="center">Ecological prior reasoning (with ABC-rejection, Brms and JAGS) </h1>  <br />

Welcome to this repository! It contains different useful scripts and examples on statistics, mainly consisting of the "Bayesian" kind. From here on
I will only use the term posterior (Bayesian model, with credibility intervals) or likelihood (Frequentist model, with confidence intervals) as
both are used as buzz-words. The posterior is formulate by including logical choice on reasonable values on the sample space the parameter of interest could occupy, which can be expected based on past evidence or/and rationalization of potential process that could have generated the data. For me this is the most intersting part. Working scripts are freely available for manipulation and pirating.<br />
