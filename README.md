#R-scripts contains random scripts with mostly "Bayesian" statistics in ecology (ABC-rejection, Brms and JAGS)<br />
This repository contains different random scripts on statistics, which consist mainly of the "Bayesian" kind. From here on
I will only use the term posterior (Bayesian model, with credibility intervals) or likelihood (Frequentist model, with confidence intervals) as
both are used as buzz-words and the term related to posterior methods are simply applied to make articles sound more sophisticated. It seems
not anymore about the logic of formulating the prior based on past evidence or/and rationalization of potential process that could have
formulated the data. I have decided not to make it an R-package consindering the amount of time and effert this costs. It is simply easier to create
A workin script an place it freely available for manipulation (pirating).
