<h1 align="center">R-scripts contains random scripts with mostly "Bayesian" statistics in ecology (ABC-rejection, Brms and JAGS) </h1>  <br />

Welcome to this repository! It contains different random useful scripts on statistics, which consist mainly of the "Bayesian" kind. From here on
I will only use the term posterior (Bayesian model, with credibility intervals) or likelihood (Frequentist model, with confidence intervals) as
both are used as buzz-words. The formulation of the posterior is by including logical choice on reasonoble value which can be expected based on past evidence 
or/and rationalization of potential process that could have generated the data. I have decided not to make it an R-package consindering 
the amount of time and effert this costs. It is simply easier to create a working script an place it freely available for manipulation (pirating) 
in a form of a pseudo-webiste on github.<br />
